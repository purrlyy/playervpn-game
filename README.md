  <h2>⚠️ Issues</h2>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
    <li><strong>AmongUS</strong>: Requires WEBGL support; may break the site if not available.</li>
    <li><strong>Smash Karts</strong>: Temporary loading issues, consider playing later.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookie Clicker</strong>: Doesn't disguise as Schoology, but the favicon works. Pin your tab!</li>
